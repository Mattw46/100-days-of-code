## Log

### R1D1 
Picked up where i last left off with CodingJS.

Completed front3 first go all tests passed.

### R1D2
Completed another CodingJS problem and forgot the length is a property not a function in JavaScript.
Hoped to get more done but was interupted.

### R1D3
Woke up late so only did 1 CodingBatJS question before work.

### R1D4
Today struggled with Lightning Web Components getting parent component to talk to the child.
Didnt help that the instructions were vague. Most frustratingly Ive built something similar for a client.
now how i did it eludes me.

### R1D5
Completed three CodingJS before moving onto work. not feeling challenged.

### R1D6
Started to do revision for Apex, not used to Java like lanaguage after being away for a while. Good to get back into practice.

### R1D7
Continued with Apex but didnt get much done. wasted time making typos and simple mistakes. Mainly due to trying to get my hour of code done first thing.
